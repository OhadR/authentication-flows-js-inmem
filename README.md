# authentication-flows-js-inmem

[![npm Package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/authentication-flows-js-inmem.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/authentication-flows-js-inmem)

This project is a **in-memory implementation** for `AuthenticationAccountRepository` of
[authentication-flows-js](https://github.com/OhadR/authentication-flows-js).

### the in-mem implementation was moved to the `authentication-flows-js` package.

For simplicity of dev, deployment and usage it was moved to [authentication-flows-js](https://github.com/OhadR/authentication-flows-js).
Now when "app" wants in-mem impl, it does not have to import this package seperately, manage versions, etc. Instead it can use 
the in-mem impl from the main package.

### Thus, this repo is read-only and not maintained anymore.
